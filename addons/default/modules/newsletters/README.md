## Newsletters

A simple email newsletter module for PyroCMS.

#### What does it do?

Add a subscribe form (widget included) to your website and start an email newsletter! Comes with 4 email templates 
to get you started and has extremely flexible send options. Administrators can send emails using a browser or schedule 
a cron job to make it automatic at a specified time each hour/day/week. Generates email open statistics and allows 
you to track the number of clicks on links embedded in the newsletter. Edit the newsletters and insert images using 
the familiar WYSIWYG editor.

#### History and License

This module was included in PyroCMS Professional until version 2.1 and sold on the PyroCMS add-on store. I've now 
pulled it out of the core of PyroCMS and licensed it under the Apache 2 license.

#### Development and Support

Your pull requests, translations, and updates for new PyroCMS versions are all welcome! If you find a problem 
with the module please create a new Issue here on Github.

Happy sending!
